Simple experimentation and playing with JavaScript. Not too much to say, really.

But, if you scroll down a little bit, you might see I did find some stuff to say - or, better yet, ramble about.

# Thoughts & Ramblings

When you're learning to code in a specific programming language, it's quite normal to experiment and tamper with the many possibilities, functions and statements the tool offers. After you dominate it, and get used to it, it's equally easy to rely on your own memory and experience, as well as official documentations to move forward. This study comprehends the middle of this process.

## The Project
* **NAME**: JavaScript Playground

* **LANGUAGE(S)**: JavaScript

* **FRAMEWORKS**: None

* **PLATFORM**: NodeJS v10+

* **LIBRARIES**: None

* **IMPORTANT**: *This project does not cover every single aspect of JavaScript. Please read the following sections for more information.*


## The Purpose
* Experiment with basic, intermediate and advanced JavaScript techniques.
* Save snippets of code to record specific functionalities.
* Learn the advanced intricacies of JavaScript that I might not have known otherwise.
* Higher focus on the core of JavaScript algorithms, not focusing on DOM or Browser functionalities (aside from AJAX).
* Help those that already know programming to learn JavaScript with well-commented, practical and to-the-point examples and demos.
* There are already hundreds, if not thousands, of JavaScript tutorials and courses. My approach leans more towards the actual experimentation.

## The Content

* **FIRST LEVEL** | This section covers the basics of JavaScript - Variable Declaration, Primitive Data Types, Functions, Objects, Arrays and Statements. **Files 000 through 007**.
* **FORTRESS** | This section covers more intermediate possibilities, like Nested Objects and Arrays, AJAX, JSON, Closures, Iteration and High Order Functions. **Files 008 through 013**.
* **CASTLE** | This section covers the real good stuff needed to actually work with JavaScript in more complex and complete ways, like Promises, Asynchronous Functions, Generators, Constructors, Factories and Classes. **Files 014 through 017**.
* **BONUS STAGE** | This section covers interesting and useful things we can do with JavaScript that are good to know: Regular Expressions, and some new ECMAScript functionalities. **Files 018 through 022**.

## A Practical Approach

A long time ago, I did not get **JavaScript**. It was ironically too simplistic to understand at first, specially coming fresh out of C and Java - clearly more complex and more sophisticated languages. I was still in my early months of college - therefore, I had yet to enroll myself into a proper work environment in my area. But then, necessity came: time went on, and suddenly I found myself loving JavaScript, and working with a **NodeJS API** on the daily. How did that happen?

Let's rewind a little bit to the first time I had to use JavaScript professionally. After I finished my graduation project - a mobile application using Java for Android - and was offered a position to kick start the new Mobile department at the company I was working at during that time, this now-beloved, old-arch-nemesis of mine rose again. The particularity at hand was the development of Mobile applications using Ionic and Angular, which had its controllers based around **TypeScript** - a stronger variant of JavaScript.

Seeing TypeScript being used in a practical, effective environment, and using an Object Oriented architecture with strong typification helped me to get used to it, coming straight out of Java. I tend to believe TypeScript helped me with the transition. When we finally decided to migrate our back-end environment to a modern approach, NodeJS was on the top of the contenders list; and, since I was already used to TypeScript, the passage from it to JavaScript was, sincerely, a "cakewalk".

On that occasion, finally, **it clicked** - everything made sense as to why JavaScript didn't seem to make too much sense to me in the beginning: it was not about the different paradigms between JS and other languages, it was not the weaker typification, and it was definitely not the syntax - it was the way most of the content I was looking through did not focus on **concept and practicality**.

Nowadays, JavaScript is a very enhanced language. Thousands of libraries are easily and readily available; lots of older and newer frameworks still go for JavaScript as their main language; and, with the help of NodeJS, we can even use the language for server-side operations. It is a fantastic environment for old and new developers, eager to learn some high-level programming, and it all begins with: **the concept**.

**Concept** is all about comprehension. JavaScript is known to be misunderstood - somehow thankfully, as it makes me feel less lonely. Anyone can sit down and write some effective code and call it a day, but if you don't understand its applicability, you will be limited to what you have seen being possible, but not what you can actually make possible yourself. You know you can declare `let hello = 'world';` and it will work, but what can you actually do with this information? Well, you've just been granted a whole package of methods provided by `String.prototype`! You can experiment with this quite literal "world" (heh) you just created, see how far you can go, and what the language enables you to do on your own. And that brings us to the next point: **the practicality**.

**Practicality** is all about experimentation. You need to have some time for the programming language and yourself, sit down, and try to understand it. Read through documentation, don't rely on occasional solutions, and create some personal projects just for the sake of **building personal experience**. JavaScript is perfect for such a process, seeing as it doesn't really require you to structure and compile your code. You can actually create a bunch of something that you think might work and test it in a safe and simple environment - and what doesn't work will present you with something new to learn.

Let's say there is an approach to learning new programming skills as a **Practical Developer**. Talking about theoretical applications of technology is illuminating, and something I personally think you have to work yourself through to learn new information. However, there are benefits that come from escaping the theory and going for experimentation.

## The Conclusion

With the constant and exponential growth of JavaScript frameworks and its many frameworks, the language exceeded itself as a modern powerhouse in continuous evolution, still with some undiscovered potential. Learning how a technology works is quite important and interesting, but the natural dominance will only come from experience and experimentation.

Despite the quiet and steady rise of TypeScript - which is happening for excellent reasons - JavaScript is, in my opinion, one of the best languages to kick start your career with, and to learn how to code in general. It may be simpler and less precarious than others, but it's still inherently interesting. There are a lot of functionalities I did not even come close to experiment with, and some of them are more focused on the theoretical aspect of JavaScript rather than the technical one - ironically. If the time comes, I might update this project with some more additional features.
