These are my personal tips for the next steps to be a JavaScript developer.

* Experiment more with the language.

* Read the [33 JavaScript Concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) repository, **very important**!
* Learn about [Event Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop).
* Learn about the [Strict Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
* Learn about other [Advanced Concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/) found at Mozilla ("Advanced" section).
